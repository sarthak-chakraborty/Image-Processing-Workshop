DAY 1:

On the first day of the Robotix Winter Workshop 2016, an introduction mainly to C language and Visual Studio was given.
In the introduction to C, first the basics of C, that is, printf-scanf function, variable and constants, if-else conditions,
looping statements, array, functions and structures were taught.
	In the tutorial for Visual Studio, we were asked to first install it on our laptops and then start a new project. A
sample code was given which we were to type in the Visual Studio interface and execute it. We were then taught about OpenCV
and the code was explained to us in detail.

The code mainly creates an image of Mat class and then execute the code suct that we have the output window coloured.

The given sample code is:
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <opencv2\highgui\highgui.hpp>
#include <opencv2\imgproc\imgproc.hpp>
#include <opencv2\core\core.hpp>

using namespace cv;
using namespace std;

void displayimage(Mat image,String windowname)
{
	imshow(windowname, image);
}

Mat readimage(String filename)
{
	return imread(filename);
}

void createimagesampe()
{
	Mat temp2(500, 500, CV_8UC3, 255);
	for (int i = 0; i < temp2.rows; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < temp2.cols; j++)
		{
			temp2.at<Vec3b>(i, j)[2] = 255;
			temp2.at<Vec3b>(i, j)[1] = 0;
			temp2.at<Vec3b>(i, j)[1] = 0;
		}
	}
	displayimage(temp2, "random");
}

int main()
{
createimagesampe();
int iKey = waitKey(50);
waitKey(0);
	return 0;
}


	From today's course. I get to have some idea about OpenCV. Also, I get to run a program in Visual Studio and do simple
tasks regarding changing the colour of the output window page, or create a chessboard, or blacken a picture.

We were also given homeworks. They are:
1. Load an image of your choice, black out any one half of it.
2. Create a chessboard image.
